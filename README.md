🧠 Agent-Based Modelling Project
This project simulates the spread of infectious disease using an agent-based approach to observe individual behavior and its impact on the system over time.

🎯 Objective
To explore how individual agents' behaviors influence the emergent properties of a complex system using an ABM simulation.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
    Platform: NetLogo 

    Language: NetLogo 

    Visualization: In-built simulation display or custom output graphs

📌 Features

    Multiple agent types  (infected, recovered, susceptible)

    Customizable parameters (infection rate, infection time, survival rate)

    Time-based simulation with charts for visual analysis


▶️ How to Run
🧪 If using NetLogo:

    Open NetLogo.

    Load the file: your-model.nlogo

    Click Setup to initialize.

    Click Go to start the simulation.

📽️ Screenshots / Demo
   Screenshots are available in screenshot folder

📊 Output

    Real-time simulation interface

    Charts displaying number of agents per state ( susceptible, infected, recovered)

    Logs or graphs of agent behavior over time
